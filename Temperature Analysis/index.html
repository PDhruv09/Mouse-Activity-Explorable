        <h1>Mouse Temperature Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            Can body temperature predict mouse activity levels? 
            <strong>And</strong> do males and females exhibit different thermoregulatory patterns? 
            <strong>But</strong> how do external factors like circadian rhythms and estrus cycles influence temperature fluctuations? 
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, analyzing these patterns can help us understand biological rhythms more deeply.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Body temperature fluctuates throughout the day and can be a strong indicator of metabolic activity. 
            <strong>But</strong> do males and females experience these fluctuations differently? 
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we will analyze temperature variations to see how they correlate with biological cycles and behavioral activity.

        <h2>Uncovering the Insights That Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Body temperature is a critical indicator of metabolic function and overall health.  
            <strong>And</strong> fluctuations in temperature can reveal patterns of energy expenditure, stress response, and biological rhythms.  
            <strong>But</strong> do male and female mice regulate temperature differently, and if so, what factors contribute to these differences?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, studying temperature variations provides valuable insights into thermoregulation, circadian rhythms, and hormonal effects on physiology.

    <!-- Static Visualization: Average Temperature Trends -->

        <h2>Average Temperature Trends</h2>
        <p>
            This visualization shows the **average temperature cycles** for male and female mice.
            <strong>But</strong> do these trends remain consistent over time?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, let's explore temperature fluctuations across different biological states.

        <h2>Diving Deeper: Individual Differences</h2>
        <p>
            Group averages provide insights, <strong>but</strong> they might obscure individual variability. 
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, letâ€™s analyze temperature fluctuations at an individual level.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Static Visualization: Female Mice -->
    <section id="female-temp-analysis">
        <h2>Female Mouse Temperature Patterns</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the **average body temperature of each female mouse** over the study period.
            <strong>But</strong> does temperature vary significantly between individuals?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, let's compare different mice to see who exhibits the most extreme fluctuations.
        </p>
        <div id="femaleTemperatureChart"></div>
        <p class="annotation">ðŸ“Š *The dashed line represents the overall female average temperature. Some mice (e.g., f5) have much higher body temperatures, which may indicate increased activity levels during estrus cycles.*</p>

    <!-- Static Visualization for Male Mice -->
    <section id="male-temp-analysis">
        <h2>Male Mouse Temperature Variability</h2>
        <p>
            Similarly, male mice also exhibit temperature fluctuations.
            <strong>But</strong> without an estrus cycle, do they follow the same rhythmic patterns?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we compare their temperature trends with female mice to see if biological cycles drive these changes.
        </p>
        <div id="maleTemperatureChart"></div>
        <p class="annotation">ðŸ“ˆ *Male mice tend to have more stable body temperatures, as indicated by the lower variance compared to female mice.*</p>

    <!-- Interactive Visualization -->
    <section id="interactive-temp-exploration">
        <h2>Interactive Exploration</h2>
        <p>
            While group patterns provide useful insights, <strong>what if we could select individual mice</strong> and compare their temperature trends dynamically?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we introduce an interactive tool for deeper exploration.
        </p>

        <!-- Mouse Selection (Multiple Select) -->
        <label>Select Mice:
            <select id="mouseSelection" multiple></select>

        <p class="annotation">ðŸ”Ž *Use this interactive chart to observe how different mice deviate from the average. Do some follow a predictable cycle, while others show random variations?*</p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section id="final-insights">
        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            We set out to explore whether **temperature variations** align with biological cycles. 
            <strong>And</strong> we found that while **both genders show daily fluctuations, female mice exhibit stronger periodic patterns** likely tied to the estrus cycle.
            <strong>But</strong> not all individuals conform to these trends.
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, our study suggests that while biological rhythms shape behavior, individual differences still play a crucial role in temperature regulation.
