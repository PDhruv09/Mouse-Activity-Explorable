        <h1>Estrus Cycle Impact on Mouse Physiology</h1>
        <p>
            Does the estrus cycle affect female mouse activity and temperature?  
            <strong>And</strong> how significant are these changes compared to the off-cycle phase?  
            <strong>But</strong> are these trends consistent across all mice?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, by analyzing temperature and activity fluctuations, we can uncover meaningful biological patterns.

    <section id="problem-statement">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The estrus cycle plays a key role in reproductive biology,  
            <strong>but</strong> how does it impact general activity and temperature regulation?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, our goal is to analyze how these physiological metrics change depending on the estrus cycle phase.

        <h2>Uncovering the Insights That Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Hormonal fluctuations can influence metabolism, sleep patterns, and overall behavior.  
            <strong>And</strong> understanding these changes helps researchers in fields such as behavioral neuroscience and medicine.  
            <strong>But</strong> if the estrus cycle affects physiological patterns in predictable ways,  
            <strong>therefore</strong> it could offer insights into how hormonal cycles regulate activity across species.

        <h2>Comparing Activity and Temperature Across Estrus Cycles</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart compares **average activity levels and body temperature** when mice are on and off the estrus cycle.  
            <strong>But</strong> does this pattern hold for all individuals?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we need to investigate variations in individual mice.

        <h2>Diving Deeper: Individual Variations</h2>
        <p>
            While group averages provide useful insights,  
            <strong>but</strong> they might obscure individual-level variations.  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, let‚Äôs analyze activity and temperature changes in individual mice.

            This visualization highlights **how individual female mice behave while on the estrus cycle**.  
            <strong>But</strong> do some mice exhibit extreme variations compared to others?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we must examine these fluctuations closely.

        <h2>Individual Mouse Temperature & Activity (Off Cycle)</h2>
        <p>
            What happens when mice are off the estrus cycle?  
            <strong>And</strong> do they return to a stable state?  
            <strong>But</strong> is this stability consistent across all mice?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we compare this to the on-cycle phase.

            Not all mice follow the same pattern,

            <strong>Therefore</strong>, the interactive tool below allows us to select different mice and compare their estrus-cycle behaviors dynamically.

    <!-- Summary of Findings -->

        <h2>Final Insights</h2>
        <p>
            We aimed to explore how **the estrus cycle influences female mice's activity and temperature.**  
            <strong>And</strong> our findings indicate that while temperature remains relatively stable,  
            <strong>activity levels tend to increase significantly during the on-cycle phase.**  
            <strong>But</strong> these trends are not uniform across all mice.  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, individual variations must be considered when studying reproductive behavior and hormonal cycles.
