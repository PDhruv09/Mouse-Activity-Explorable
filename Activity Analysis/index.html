        <h1>Mouse Activity Analysis</h1>
        <p>Can we predict mouse activity levels based on biological and environmental factors? Does gender influence activity, and if so, why? Let's explore the patterns hidden in the data.</p>

    <!-- Problem Introduction -->
    <section id="problem-intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Mice are nocturnal, meaning their activity should peak when the lights are off. 
            <strong>But</strong> do males and females exhibit the same behavior? 
            <strong>And</strong> how does the estrus cycle affect female activity?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, by analyzing their minute-by-minute movement, we can determine whether external factors influence activity patterns.

        <h2>Uncovering the Insights That Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Activity levels provide crucial insights into the behavioral patterns of mice.  
            <strong>And</strong> by understanding how and when mice are most active, researchers can study biological rhythms, energy expenditure, and potential health implications.  
            <strong>But</strong> do these activity levels remain constant, or are they influenced by external factors like gender, light cycles, or hormonal changes?  
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, analyzing activity fluctuations allows us to uncover key behavioral and physiological patterns that can inform future studies in neuroscience and medicine.

        <h2>Comparing Average Activity: Male vs. Female</h2>
        <p>
            The bar chart below compares the overall average activity levels of male and female mice across the dataset.
            <strong>But</strong> does this tell the full story? Let's dig deeper.

    <!-- Explanation of First Visualization -->
    <section id="explanation-1">
        <h2>Understanding the Trends</h2>
        <p>
            We see that males, on average, have a higher activity level than females.
            <strong>But</strong> this does not account for variations over time. 
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we need to explore individual patterns to see if all mice follow this trend or if some outliers exist.
        </p>

    <!-- Static Visualization 2: Female Mice Activity -->
    <section id="static-visualization-2">
        <h2>How Active Are Female Mice Over Time?</h2>
        <p>
            This line plot tracks the activity of individual female mice over time.
            <strong>But</strong> females go through an estrus cycle every four days, which could influence behavior.
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we should see fluctuations in activity that might correlate with their reproductive cycle.

    <!-- Explanation of Second Visualization -->
    <section id="explanation-2">
        <h2>Interpreting Female Mouse Activity</h2>
        <p>
            The data suggests that female mice experience spikes in activity at regular intervals.
            <strong>But</strong> is this a universal trend for all mice?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we must examine the male mice's activity patterns for comparison.

    <!-- Static Visualization 3: Male Mice Activity -->
    <section id="static-visualization-3">
        <h2>How Active Are Male Mice Over Time?</h2>
        <p>
            This graph represents the activity of individual male mice. Unlike females, males do not experience an estrus cycle.
            <strong>But</strong> do they still show periodic fluctuations in activity?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, comparing male and female trends will help us isolate cycle-driven behaviors.

        <div id="staticChart3"></div>

    <section id="explanation-3">
        <h2>Interpreting Male Mouse Activity</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike female mice, male mice display a relatively stable pattern of activity throughout the day.
            <strong>But</strong> does this stability mean all males behave similarly?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, we introduce an interactive tool to explore individual patterns.

            <strong>But</strong> does the average reflect the reality of individual differences?
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, by toggling different individuals, we can observe whether some mice are more active than others.

    <!-- Final Insights -->
    <section id="final-insights">
        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Our initial question was whether gender impacts activity. 
            <strong>And</strong> we found that while males are slightly more active on average, female activity is influenced by the estrus cycle.
            <strong>But</strong> not all individuals follow the average trend.
            <strong>Therefore</strong>, while general trends exist, individual variation remains a key factor in behavioral studies.
