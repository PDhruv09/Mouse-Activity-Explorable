        <p>Exploring how mice activity levels fluctuate throughout the day.</p>

    <!-- Problem Introduction -->
    <section id="problem-intro">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Do male or female mice exhibit higher activity levels? Understanding their behavior can provide insights into circadian rhythms and health patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Static Visualization 1: Average Activity (Male vs. Female) -->
    <section id="static-visualization-1">
        <h2>Average Activity of Male vs. Female Mice</h2>
        <p>This graph shows the average activity level of male and female mice over a 24-hour period.</p>
        <div id="staticChart1"></div>
    </section>

    <!-- Explanation of First Visualization -->
    <section id="explanation-1">
        <h2>Understanding the Trends</h2>
        <p>From the graph, we can see whether males or females are generally more active and how their activity varies throughout the day.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Digging Deeper -->
    <section id="story-transition">
        <h2>Why Look at Individual Mice?</h2>
        <p>While averages are useful, they do not show individual variations. Some mice may be more active or inactive compared to their group.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Static Visualization 2: Female Mice Activity -->
    <section id="static-visualization-2">
        <h2>Female Mouse Activity Over Time</h2>
        <p>Each line represents the activity of an individual female mouse, with the average highlighted. The most and least active mice are marked.</p>
        <div id="staticChart2"></div>
    </section>

    <!-- Explanation of Second Visualization -->
    <section id="explanation-2">
        <h2>Interpreting Female Mouse Activity</h2>
        <p>Do female mice follow a general trend, or are there significant outliers? We can observe the lowest and highest activity mice compared to the average.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Static Visualization 3: Male Mice Activity -->
    <section id="static-visualization-3">
        <h2>Male Mouse Activity Over Time</h2>
        <p>Each line represents the activity of an individual male mouse, with the average highlighted. The most and least active mice are marked.</p>
        <div id="staticChart3"></div>
    </section>

    <!-- Explanation of Third Visualization -->
    <section id="explanation-3">
        <h2>Interpreting Male Mouse Activity</h2>
        <p>Comparing individual male mice, do their activity levels align with the average, or do some stand out?</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Summary Comparison -->
    <section id="summary-comparison">
        <h2>Male vs. Female Activity: A Deeper Look</h2>
        <p>Comparing the individual activity levels, do male and female mice show distinct behavioral differences?</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Interactive Visualization -->
    <section id="interactive-visualization">
        <h2>Explore Mouse Activity</h2>
        <p>Select a gender and choose specific mice to compare. You can include or exclude the average activity.</p>
        <label for="genderSelector">Select Gender:</label>
        <select id="genderSelector">

    <!-- Final Insights -->
    <section id="final-insights">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Now that you have explored the data, what trends do you observe? Do your findings match expectations?</p>
